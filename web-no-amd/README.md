# MEAN Book Web Without AMD Module (Front-end)

This module was developed using AngularJS 1.x and Bootstrap. It's an alternative implementation based on tag 1.2.0 that doesn't use the RequireJS AMD library.

To use this module instead of the default web module, follow the steps below:
- Edit the file located in the path server/src/app/config.js.
- Change the webBasePath property to the following value: '/../../../web-no-amd/'.
